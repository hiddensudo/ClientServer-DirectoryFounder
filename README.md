# ClientServer-DirectoryFounder

Directory Founder is a software application for finding the full path to a directory. To use the software application, you need to run 2 terminals. One will be the server, the other will be the client.

To find the path to a directory, you need to write the command `/getpath`, after which you specify the starting path and the name of the directory you want to find.

After some time on the server side, you will be able to see a message from the client with the full path to the file.
